<h3>About:</h3>
Hong Kong is an autonomous territory, and former British colony, in
southeastern China. Its vibrant, densely populated urban centre is
a major port and global financial hub with a skyscraper-studded
skyline. Central (the business district) features architectural

Street Night Market.
<p>Occupied by the UK in 1841, Hong Kong was formally ceded by
China the following year; various adjacent lands were added later
in the 19th century. Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and
the UK on 19 December 1984, Hong Kong became the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China on 1 July
1997. In this agreement, China promised that, under its "one
country, two systems" formula, China's socialist economic system
would not be imposed on Hong Kong and that Hong Kong would enjoy a
"high degree of autonomy" in all matters except foreign and defense
affairs for the subsequent 50 years.</p>
